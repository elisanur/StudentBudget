# Topic spesification and description

### Topic: Budget calculator

I will implement a program that allows the user calculate the monthly, weekly and daily budget. The program will present the income and expenses separately. User can name and add headers to both income and expenses which makes the program user friendly. The program is designed for students, because it will be easy to use and it helps to understand the current balance.

### Users:

- Student or other user

### Functions for users:

- Composing an expense title
- Composing an income title
- Removing a title
- Exporting budget review in a .txt file

### Program's print options

- Budget review shows how much money is there in total and how much there is to save/spend or if the balance is negative.

### Possibilities for extensions

- Importing the budget calculations to a others file types, eg. pdf
- Separated section for loans and savings
